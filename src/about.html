        <p>Hello, I’m Hayat Soma. I’m a software developer with a passion for building dynamic web applications and exploring new technologies. I’ve recently completed a Full Stack Web Development program, and I’m eager to continue honing my skills in both front-end and back-end development.</p>

        <p>My journey into development began with a fascination for solving problems and creating solutions. As I delved deeper into the world of programming, I became particularly drawn to web technologies. My goal is to build scalable, user-friendly applications that solve real-world problems. When I’m not coding, you can find me reading tech blogs, participating in coding challenges, or exploring new frameworks and tools.</p>

      <h2>My Journey into Development</h2>
      <p>I started my career in a non-technical field, but I quickly realized my true passion was in technology. After learning the basics of coding through online tutorials and bootcamps, I decided to pursue a career in software development. Now, I have hands-on experience with Angular, Node.js, MongoDB, and other tools, and I’m always seeking opportunities to learn and grow.</p>

      <h2>What I’m Passionate About</h2>
      <p>I’m passionate about building products that make a difference. My focus is on web development, creating intuitive user interfaces, and solving complex problems with efficient solutions. I also enjoy mentoring others and being a part of the developer community.</p>
